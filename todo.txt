hello ryan whenever you work on this again 

we have finished the core commands where we can set start, end, renderer, output location and select and add render files


TO DO:

set limit of 5 blender files for queue

setup 
GET CONFIG SETTINGS
RUN COMMAND TO RENDER FILE
PYTHON TERMINAL PROGRESS BAR (get code from external renderer.py)

maybe add a hyperclickable link to open output folders

OHHHH
for the output folder based off the name of the blender file assign the render follder as such: BLEND_RANDOMINT_RENDER so we dont mess up stuff


then just do like bug testing and stress testing ig
idk im tired
i just wanna d i e

code fuckin works tho so thats cool just dont fuck it up ryan ;)
